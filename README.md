This was built using @superguigui excellent three.js starter kit 

A great repository for putting together three.js projects quickly.

Thanks especially to Flowen's excellent blog post on making a visualiser in three.js. A very good read for anyone that might also be interested.

This is really useful for getting a visualiser up and running and covers the basics of how to use frequency data.
